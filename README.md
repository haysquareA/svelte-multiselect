Usage

Using the Custom MultiSelect component is a piece of cake! Just follow these simple steps:

Import the component into your SvelteKit project.
Include it in your components or pages.

Single Use
If you need only one Custom MultiSelect in your application, simply use it directly:


<script>
  import MultiSelect from '@haysquare/svelte-multiselect';
</script>

<MultiSelect
  {selectableItems}
  {initialSelectedItems}
  on:change={handleSelectionChange}
/>


Multi Use

If you need multiple instances of Custom MultiSelect, you can import and use it multiple times:

<script>
  import MultiSelect from '@haysquare/svelte-multiselect';
</script>

<MultiSelect
  {selectableItems1}
  {initialSelectedItems1}
  on:change={handleSelectionChange1}
/>

<MultiSelect
  {selectableItems2}
  {initialSelectedItems2}
  on:change={handleSelectionChange2}
/>

Props

`selectableItems`: An array of items that can be selected.
`initialSelectedItems`: An optional array of items that are initially selected.
`on:change`: An event that emits the selected items whenever the selection changes.
